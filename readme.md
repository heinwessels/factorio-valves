# Valves

[![shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ko--fi-Donate%20-hotpink?logo=kofi&logoColor=white)](https://ko-fi.com/stringweasel) [![shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=orange&label=Factorio&query=downloads_count&suffix=%20downloads&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmods.factorio.com%2Fapi%2Fmods%2Fvalves)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/valves)

Fully functioning overflow, top-up and one-way(check) as separate entities. The thresholds can be configured using shortcuts.

## Shortcuts (configurable)
- **Numpad +**: Increase threshold for overflow or top-up valves.
- **Numpad -**: Decrease threshold for overflow or top-up valves.

# Settings
- Startup settings for default thresholds for overflow and top-up valves.
- A startup setting for the valves' pump speed when it's open.

## Compatibility
Should be comptatibile with most mods. If it's not compatible, please let me know.
- **Pyanodons**: Will automatically migrate old Factorio 1.1 valves to their 2.0 counter part.

# UPS Impact
These valves use the prototypes provided by the game engine. That means it probably has less of a UPS impact than normal pumps. There are no fluid calculations done in this mod itself.
