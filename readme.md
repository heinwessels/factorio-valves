Configurable valves for your fluids. Allows for overflow, top-up and passthrough valves, just like Flow Control. Fully configurable with custom levels, as well as being connectable to the circuit network.

# Compatibility

Should be comptatibile with most mods. If it's not compatible, please let me know.
    - **Pyanodons**: Will automatically migrate old Factorio 1.1 valves to their 2.0 counter part.

Other mods can also define their own configurable valves. TODO.

# Known bugs
- There is some weird fluidbox arrows being drawn at the moment. This is awaiting API changes to fix.
- This valve doesn't fully support filters (that's part of all pumps).

# Credits
