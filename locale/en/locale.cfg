[mod-setting-description]
valves-default-threshold-top_up=The default threshold when placing a new valve. It can be adjusted after placement.
valves-default-threshold-overflow=The default threshold when placing a new valve. It can be adjusted after placement.
valves-pump-speed=The amount of fluid to pump every second when the valve is open. Applies to all valves added by this mod: overflow, top-up and one-way.
valves-disable-py-migration=Disabled automatic migration of PyIndustry valves to this mod.
