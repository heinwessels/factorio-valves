configurable-valve=Configurable valve

[entity-description]
configurable-valve=A valve that can be configured as overflow, top-up or one-way with custom thresholds using circuit conditions. The input ([img=virtual-signal/signal-I]) and output ([img=virtual-signal/signal-O]) levels are always available as percentage.

configurable-valves-switch=Allows cycling through the three main valve modes: overflow, top-up and one-way.
configurable-valves-plus=Adjusts the threshold used for overflow or topup valves.
configurable-valves-minus=Adjusts the threshold used for overflow or topup valves.
